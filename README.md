# Histopathologic Cancer Detection
This repo is part of my Master's thesis (written in Polish), which will be defended very soon at Warsaw School of Economics. 
I will put it here as soon as receive confirmation from my University if this is allowed.

Currently the repo consists of two files:
* Jupyter Notebook with the best model chosen from over 50 that were evaluated. It also includes an abstract of the thesis (in English)
* .pth file which is the model saved after 8 epochs. If loaded correctly, it should return very similar results to described in the abstract.

Data comes from [Kaggle Playground Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection)
